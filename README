- initialize a hash map

void *hash_map_set (hash_map_t *map,

void *hash_map_get (hash_map_t *map,
                    char *key)

- retrieve from @map the value corresponding to @key

void *hash_map_unset (hash_map_t *map,
                      char *key)

- delete the entry with @key from @map. returns @value which _should_ be
